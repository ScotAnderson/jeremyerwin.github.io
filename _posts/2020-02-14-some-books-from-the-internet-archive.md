I was recently pointed to an ebay auction selling a flash drive of 192 dressmaking ebooks. Curious to learn whether this trove had unearthed a hitherto unknown to me trove of such books, I compared the manifest to what I could find on the internet archive. Here is a selection, with links back to archive.org. We should alway keep in mind that archive.org is always republishing material, as new libraries decide to contribute, or older libraries conmtinue with their digitization projects.
