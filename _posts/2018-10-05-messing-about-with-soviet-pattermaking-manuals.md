Soviet Patternmaking manuals are weird. There's a fair bit of calculus. Perhaps that's because of how the research was packaged,

In the 1960s and 1970s, the standard drafting method was Центральной опытнотехнической швейной лабораторией, (Central Experimental Sewing Laboratory)
or ЦОТШЛ for short.

I figure it's worth my while to code up a few examples, and see if java script can handle the cyrillic.
