Soviet Patternmaking manuals are weird. There's a fair bit of calculus. Perhaps that's because of how the research was packaged,
but one has the that a new sort of fashion was being engineered for _homo sovieticus_. There are probably equally nerdy publications in 
english sequestered behind paywalls and hefy licensing fees.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the standard drafting method was Центральной опытнотехнической швейной лабораторией, (Central Scientific and Research Institute of the Apparel Industry)
or ЦОТШЛ for short. It seems realatiely straightforward.

I figure it's worth my while to code up a few examples, and see if java script can handle the cyrillic. I've got a manual of soviet lingerie that needs encoding. In the meantime, here's a horribly basic dress pattern-- without even a bit of waist shaping,

I'm still trying to figure out how to retranslate it into english-- it was easier to just encode the russian original, without translation.
