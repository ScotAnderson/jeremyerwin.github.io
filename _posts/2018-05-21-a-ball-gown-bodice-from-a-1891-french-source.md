Recently, I've come into a large collection of French Pattern magazines from the 1890s (La Mode Pratique). They include many many pattern drafts. Unfortunately, many of the drafts refer to previous issues, which tend to be both rare and expensive. In an effort to reconstruct the missing information, I've taken to reading french pattern books-- a process that sorely tests my rather poor understanding of the language. Luckily, pattern books the world over tend to use a rather constricted vocabulary. 

From [Rhein Schéfer, Ève.  _Méthode de coupe et d'assemblage pour robes de femmes et vêtements d'enfants : trousseau et layette_ Paris. 1891](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204052z) (pp 113-122) comes this ball gown bodice (Corsage de Bal). It is based on 7 measurements. The measurements given here, are in large part, derived from measuring the original pattern plates, a inexact process that gives far too much credit to the engraver...

| French | English translation | default value
