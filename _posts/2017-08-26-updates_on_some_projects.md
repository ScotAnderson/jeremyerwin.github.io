I've been busy looking at an old issue of La Mode Illustree, breaking in a old graphics tablet, and writing up some translations.
My latest toy is an GD series Wacom Intuos-- it's 12 inche by 12 inchs, which is just large enough to preserve the angular 
relations found in a typical pattern-- too small, and it requires far too much "tiling". Too large, and it starts to get 
horrifically expensive. Unfortutunately, both Pattern Master and Dratsight don't seem to be set up to input a "sketch." Technically, if 
I rapidly tap the stylus against the tablet, I can get a series of dots-- or connected lines, but it's a long way from just
drawing the details. Luckily [LibreCAD](https://librecad.org) allows a more natural sketching action.

Here's a corset for a girl of 12-14 years. In AutoCAD2004 format since, *apparently* Adobe Illustrator doen't like the latest version of DWG)

[corset2004](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3u26r506yuna13b/lmi%20corsetr2004.dwg?dl=0) Not normally my cup of tea-- but since I
have a 1894 guide to drafting girl's corsets from meausrements-- well-- I'm hoping that I can make some connections between the 
1894 patternmaking scheme and this 1889 pattern. 


Prnting so that the back meausrement is 34 cm and a bit is left as an exercise for the reader. One of the reasons why 
patternmaster is so useful-- less work to manage ones tilings. 

[La Mode Illustre√©--(4 August 1889](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jz6ikhxb79lyevm/lmi.pdf?dl=0) the source of the corset pattern.
