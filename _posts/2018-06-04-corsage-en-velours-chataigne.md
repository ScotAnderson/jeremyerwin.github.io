I've decided to look at the tissue patterns included in my 1892 volume of La Robe Pratique. As I was glancing through
an otherwise unremarkable dressmaking manual,

[Baughman, J. S,  Baughman, M. E. _Baughman's advanced hints on dress cutting_ Burlington, Iowa. 1892](https://archive.org/details/baughmansadvance00baug)

I came across this page on capes:

Besides the [pelerine](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!?sortBy=Relevance&material=Pelerines&offset=40&PerPage=20), it provides a fairly complete set of patterns-- bodice back, side panels, front, sleeves and collar, and should let me reverse engineer LMP's pattern drafting system.

Getting the tissue pattern into my computer proved a bit of an ordeal. I first traced the pattern pieces onto some semi transparent Exam Table Paper, and then drew a grid on those pattern pieces. It took me a while to figure out a viable technique, thus asense of blog posts.

Right now, the pattern is in a .las (Wild ginger Patternmaster) file, and IIRC, licensing prolems complicate the sharing of theis sort of file. I should have it available as a DXF file shortly.

In the mean time, if any one has any suggestions on how best to import tissue paper pattern sheets that have been bound into a book, I'd be glad to hearof them. Perhaps I can get an old and obsolete (and therefore inexpensive) large scale drawing tablet, and reverse engineer the RS232 connection
