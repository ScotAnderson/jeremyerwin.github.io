Here's a basic sleeve pattern, taken from _La Mode Pratique_ 6:168 (14) 3 Avril 1897

| French | English translation | default value |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Contour d'emmanchure | armhole | 50 cm |
| Longueur de l'emmanchure au poignet| shoulder to wrist | 58 cm |
| Longueur de l'emmanchure au coude | shoulder to elbow | 31.5 cm |
| Longeuer du coude au poignet | elbow to wrist | 26.5 cm |

It's the basis for a long series of articles taken from La Mode Pratique throughout 1897, so I will be returning to this basic 
pattern later on. I think it shoud also be applicable to patterns published in 1892, in the event that I cannot find those early missing issues.
