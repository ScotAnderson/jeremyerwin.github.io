In the mid 1890s, the fashionable sleeve was a puffy sleeve, peaking in volume around 1895 or 1896.

(from _Le Mode de Paris_, August, 1895. Le Mode de Paris was one the fashion magazines put out by the A McDowell Co, that promised to 
bring the latest French fashions to an American Audience. Inside the Front cover of many of these Magazines was a pattern drafting column called
"Practical Lessons on Dressmaking", presenting a cape, a sleeve, a skirt, or a jacket. Many of those lessons assumed that the reader
had a master pattern, or better yet, a McDowell Garment Drafting Machine.)

The trend started to appear in about 1892. Here is a modestly puffed sleeve from _La Mode Pratique_ 1:277-278 (35) 6 Ao√ªt 1892. It was used as the basis
for even larger sleeves, but I haven't quite figured out these other drafts yet.

The suggested meausrements arent given, so I'll use the values from the previous pattern

The following changes are made from the previous pattern: 

_P_ is 6 cm above _F_
The curve _GK_ is rotated out 3 cm (producing _Q_)
The line _HD_ is rotated out 4 cm (producing _R_)


| French | English translation | default value |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Contour d'emmanchure | armhole | 50 cm |
| Longueur de l'emmanchure au poignet| shoulder to wrist | 58 cm |
| Longueur de l'emmanchure au coude | shoulder to elbow | 31.5 cm |
| Longeuer du coude au poignet | elbow to wrist | 26.5 cm |
