One of the resources at the Library of Congresss in the French fashion journal _Revue de La Mode_, published in the 1880s and 1890s. I found a
dressmaking column by the name of Etude de Coupe. Witten by A Guerre and A Domange, it is similar in content to _La Mode Pratique's_ Coupe et 
Assemblage.

A series of these columns in 1893 covered equestrienne fashion-- though whether it was parctical or faddish (LMP mentions Albert de Dreex's novels), I 
canot say at this point. They are collected in this [pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3lnzno8hhacj32y/skirts%20and%20breaches%20for%20the%20amazone.pdf?dl=0)

A first stab at the custom made skirt can be found in this [dynamic pattern applet](https://jeremyerwin.github.io/patterns/revuedelamode/JupeAmazone.html)
